# EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY
Created based on project from Teamtreehouse.com.

Used provided HTML and CSS in opening drafts, eventually altered to be 100% my own. 
If you are also student and  working on this or a similar project, feel free to reach out to me with anyquestions about this code. I've made an effort to include helpful comments anddocumentation for fellow learners. 

## Basic Structure

The employee directory calls on a public API that returns random user profiles. Clicking on one of these opens a modal window with more employee information. Some of the employees use Arabic characters, these are supported with RTL text. 

### Concepts Demonstrated

The main technologies and concepts demonstrated in this project are

* javaScript: Object Oriented Programming
* Adobe Illustrator
* SVG Graphics
* CSS Flexbox
* CSS Media Queries

## Logo
![Phrase Hunter Logo](/images/SplashImage.png)

The 'Phrase Hunter' image is found in the repository as both a Scalable Vector Graphic and a PNG. In some cases, SVGs are smaller but in this case the complexity of the images makes the PNG a smaller sized option. 

Benefits of the SVG include:
* resizable without pixelation
* contains extra data like transparency and font information

Benefits of PNG the include
* often smaller file sizes for images with complex colors
* transparency in PNG-24 files

### The typefaces used in the logo were:
The 'Phrase' text on the logo is based on 'Sidecar' by Fenotype -> https://fenotype.com/. The 'Hunter' text is loosely based on DIN Condensed, an Adobe Font ->https://fonts.adobe.com/. The Neon effect was created in Adobe Illustrator.

## CSS Queries
When implemented, images and details will be posted about: 

 * Media Queries for mobile/desktop
 * Dark/Light mode
